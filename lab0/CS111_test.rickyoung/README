Files included in lab0-405346443.tar.gz :
- lab0.c: the C source code file that can copies its standard input to its standard output
- Makefile: which contains all targets for making and running the different parts of the project
- backtrace.png: a screen snapshot of a segmentation fault and associated stack-trace
- breakpoint.png: a screen snapshot of gdb output about breakpoints and variable inspection.
- SmokeTest.sh: a bash script for testing if the program runs properly. 

Test cases in SmokeTest.sh:
1) Ran the program with an input file (included in the 
distrubtion file), create an output file, and see that the program
exited with an exit code of 0.

2) Compared that the input file and the output file had the
same content after the program was run.

3) Ensured that the correct error is thrown when unable to write
to the output file by creating and output file, removing its
write permissions, and then attempting to run the program with that
file as the output file.

4) Check that the segfault handler works by running with both
--segfault and --catch options.

5) Attempt to run the program with an input file that doesn't exist
to check that the correct error is thrown when attempting to open
the file.
