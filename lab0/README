- lab0.c: the C source code file that can copies its standard input to its standard output
- Makefile: which contains all targets for making and running the different parts of the project
- backtrace.png: a screen snapshot of a segmentation fault and associated stack-trace
- breakpoint.png: a screen snapshot of gdb output about breakpoints and variable inspection.
- SmokeTest.sh: a bash script for testing if the program runs properly. 

Test cases in SmokeTest.sh:
1) Compare input file and output file, see if they are the same, and if its exit code is 0
2) Check if the segfault handle well by running with both --segfault and --catch options.
3) Run the program with an invalid input file, check if it could detect it and exit code 2
4) Create a output file, remove the write permissions, run the program to check if it could detect invalid output file and exit code 3
